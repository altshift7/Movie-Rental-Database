# Movie Rental Database

This project is a fully relational **Movie Rental Database System** built using **MySQL**. It simulates the backend operations of a movie rental store, covering customer management, movie inventory, rental transactions, payments, and employee management. The system is designed following database normalization principles to ensure data consistency, eliminate redundancy, and maintain referential integrity.

## Key Features

- Relational Database Design: Includes well-structured tables for Customers, Movies, Genres, Rentals, Payments, and Employees.
- Data Consistency: Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity across all tables.
- Sample Data: Tables are pre-populated with realistic sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Advanced SQL Queries: Supports reports such as revenue analysis, ongoing rentals, customer activity tracking, and full rental history.
- Extensible Structure: The system design allows easy expansion using triggers, stored procedures, and integration into full-stack applications.

## Technologies Used

- MySQL – Database Management System
- SQL – Querying & Data Manipulation

## Project Flow

1. Customers register and rent movies.
2. Rental transactions are created and linked to payment records.
3. Employees manage the rental operations.
4. SQL queries generate insights into business performance, customer behavior, and inventory management.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement triggers to automatically update movie stock levels.
- Develop stored procedures for efficient rental processing.
- Integrate a REST API using backend frameworks.
- Build a web frontend for full customer and staff interaction.
