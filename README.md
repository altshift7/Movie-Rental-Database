Movie-Rental-Database
This project is a fully relational Movie Rental Database System built using MySQL. It simulates the backend operations of a movie rental store, including customer management, movie inventory, rental transactions, payments, and employee handling. The system was designed following normalization principles to ensure data consistency and eliminate redundancy.

Key Features:
Relational Database Design: Tables for Customers, Movies, Genres, Rentals, Payments, and Employees.
Data Consistency: Foreign keys and constraints ensure referential integrity between tables.
Sample Data: Pre-populated tables with realistic data for testing and demonstration.
Advanced SQL Queries: Revenue reports, ongoing rentals, customer activity, and rental history.
Extensible Structure: Can be extended with triggers, stored procedures, and integrated into full-stack applications.


Technologies Used:
MySQL (Database Management)
SQL (Data Querying & Manipulation)


Project Flow:
Customers register and rent movies.
Rentals are processed and linked with payments.
Employees manage rental operations.
Queries allow analysis of business performance, customer activity, and inventory.


Future Enhancements:
Triggers for auto-updating movie stock.
Stored procedures for rental processing.
REST API integration with backend frameworks.
Web frontend for full user interaction.
